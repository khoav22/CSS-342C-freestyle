Notes during lecture:
Write comments for you and others to understand when needed

Put in some structure for code to be more readable

Make sure the code compiles and test your code

Commit and push to Github

Usually do once you complete a method or whenever you feel necessary

Write the test code first so that you know you are solving the problem that you are needed to solve
